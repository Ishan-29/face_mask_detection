# face_mask_detection

Face Mask Detection System built with OpenCV, Keras/TensorFlow using Deep Learning to detect face masks in images as well as in real-time video.

Amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there are no efficient face mask detection applications which are now in high demand for transportation means, densely populated areas, residential districts, large-scale manufacturers and other enterprises to ensure safety. The absence of large datasets of ‘with_mask’ images has made this task cumbersome and challenging.
