# face_mask_detection

Face Mask Detection System built with OpenCV, Tensorflow using Deep Learning to detect face masks in images as well as in real-time video.

Amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there are no efficient face mask detection applications which are now in high demand for transportation means, densely populated areas, residential districts to ensure safety. The absence of large datasets of ‘with_mask’ images has made this task challenging.

This dataset consists of 4586 images belonging to two classes:

1) with_mask: 2543 images
 
2) without_mask: 2043 images

# features

This system can be used in real-time applications which require face-mask detection for safety purposes due to the outbreak of Covid-19. This project can be integrated with embedded system for application in airports, railway stations, offices, schools, and public places to ensure that public safety guidelines are followed.
